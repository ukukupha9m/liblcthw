* Make tst_traverse abort if too deep.
* Have these be in a lcthw/*.h setup and that is installed.
* Change the ifdef defenders to start with lcthw_*
* Change the radixmap to a generic "intmap" and have radix and heap sorts plugabble as callbacks.
* Add the RadixMap_sort_tail from Mongrel2 to study as an exercise.
* Need to do some kind of namespacing on the data types because stack_t exists already, probably others.
* RadixMap should take and return pointers, not plain integers as values. Integers are barely useful in the book.
* Need some sort algorithms for the darray, it's kind of useless without them, and it would make radix and heaps easier to do.
* Look up whatever tail recursion is available in GCC or others.
